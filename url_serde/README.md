Serde support for rust-url types
================================

This crate provides wrappers and convenience functions to make `rust-url` and `serde`
work hand in hand.

This crate supports `serde 0.9.0` or newer. Older versions of `serde` are natively supported by `rust-url` crate directly.

For more details, see the crate [documentation](https://docs.rs/url_serde/).
